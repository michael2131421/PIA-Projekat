        <!--U sustini, pisacu kako je ovo nas zajednicki projekat za domaci, kako smo uradili, sta smo iskoristili, kao rafo koje smo tehnologije koristili kao i gde smo studenti i te fore-->
        This online gallery project is a homework assignment given by the "Faculty of engineering sciences of Kragujevac" and done by its two students: Milan Nedić and Mihajlo Spasić.<br>The goal of the project was the creation of an online image gallery, displaying different artworks of its member artists. Not everyone is an artist though, so differing user types were thought of and created, namely the regular users and guests. These user types, as well as artists themselves, have differing privileges when it comes to the website. Another user type is the administrators whose job is, as the name suggest, to monitor the website and moderate its users.  <br>
        One of the functions available to the regular users is the ability to like and favorite certain artworks. This feature is crucial in determining the appeal, and maybe even the quality, of the artworks present. Information about the like and favorite statistics and visitations of the artworks would be availble to the artists themselves, who could do with said information as they wished. <br>
